    My attempt at having fun with the [Advent of Code 2021](https://www.adventofcode.com/events/2021/) puzzles
    in React. Source code on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/matystroia/aoc-2021/). I've marked the challenges
    I'm proudest of in the calendar below. You can use the toolbar at the bottom to read my notes and
    toggle between parts.

    “You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush
    to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh
    keys flying into the ocean!”

I started this project because I had taken a break from programming and was feeling a bit rusty. I'm happy to say that's no longer the case, and that I feel in better shape than ever.

I did the days in order, as will be pretty obvious. The amount of work that went into them was varied; challenges that didn't particularly inspire me were done in a matter of hours, while others took a couple of days.

I also took frequent breaks to explore different ideas that I had while working on the AoC challenges. You can find most of them on the [/dev](/aoc/dev) page.

You can read some more details in the notes for each day. That's also where you'll find instructkkions about how to interact with the challenge.

A **huge** thank you to all the
other projects that made this one possible:

-   [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for an extremely solid base to work from.

-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for an _amazing_ CSS framework.

-   [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for being one of the funnest libraries I've ever toyed with.

-   [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) for all the tiny utilities I didn't have to write myself.

-   [The MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for being an indispensable and comprehensive learning resource.

And last but not least

-   [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for putting together these puzzles; they've sparked in me, as in many others, the same joy that made me want to become a developer. For that I couldn't be more grateful.
