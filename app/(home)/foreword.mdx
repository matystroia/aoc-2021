    My attempt at having fun with the [Advent of Code 2021](https://www.adventofcode/events/2021/) puzzles
    in React. Source code on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/matystroia/aoc-2021/). I've marked the challenges
    I'm proudest of in the calendar below. You can use the toolbar at the bottom to read my notes and
    toggle between parts.

    “You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush
    to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh
    keys flying into the ocean!”

A **huge** thank you to all the
other projects that made this one possible:

-   [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for an extremely solid base to work from.

-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for an _amazing_ CSS framework.

-   [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for being of the funnest libraries I've ever toyed with.

-   [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) for all the tiny utilities I didn't have to write myself.

-   [The MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for being an indispensable and comprehensive learning resource.

And last but not least

-   [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for putting together these puzzles; they've sparked in me, as in many others, the same joy that made me want to become a developer. For that I couldn't be more grateful.
