## Lanternfish Overflow

The first of the memoization challenges. Or at least, the challenges where I used memoization.

Starting from this day, I'll remove any `ObjectInspector`s laying around. That's because I don't think there's any point in printing out _the actual answer_. However, if you are curios about my solution, you're free to check out the [source code](https://www.github.com/matystroia) on my GitHub page.

### On DOM performance

I can't help but be pleasantly surprised that modern browsers can handle _tens of thousands(!)_ of nodes without the page becoming totally unresponsive.

I'm way over my head when it comes to understanding the actual implementation, but I have to give props to the engineers that made it possible for me to have 14,000 snailfish on the page without performance becoming fishy.
