## Parantheses Parsing
<Tutorial>
You can hover over parantheses to highlight the pair they are a part of. Illegal characters are in red. Part 2 completes the line by making sure all pairs are closed.

IMO, the colored underline that appears when you hover over a valid pair really adds a lot. And it was really easy to implement because of `monospace` font and making sure each character has the same width. 

Then you just have to get position the underline (really just 3 quarters of a border) at the position of the minimum of the pairs, and set its width to the difference of the pair indices.
