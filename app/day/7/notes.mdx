### On styling \<input\>

I feel like some parts of the web are a bit behind the curve when it comes to styling options. On the one hand, both `flex-box` and `grid` are supported across the board. You also have 3D transforms and SVG filters working in all major browsers. On the other hand, however, you can't style a (conceptually) simple element like a range or number input without having to include a _--webkit-billion_ _--moz-vendor-prefixes_.

Here's the default range input (for your browser):

<input type="range" className="w-full" />

And here's my custom one:
<input type="range" className="crab-input w-full" />
