### On styling \<input\>

Not much to say here. Just drag the slider and see the crabs updating their values

I feel like some parts of the web are a bit behind the curve when it comes to styling options. On the one hand, incredibly useful layout systems are widely supported across the board. Nowadays you can pretty much just use both flex and grid without having to go and check [caniuse](https://caniuse.com).

On the other hand, however, you can't style a (conceptually) simple element like a range or number input without having to include a million _--webkit_ and _--moz_ vendor prefixes. And as someone who uses Firefox but is aware that the rest of the world runs Chromium browsers, it's even more painful.

Here's the default range input (for your browser):

<input type="range" className="w-full" />

And here's my custom one:
<input type="range" className="crab-input w-full" />
