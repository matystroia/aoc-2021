## Packet Windows

<Tutorial>
You can drag the windows to move them and you can close them using the button in the top right. By clicking on the bit groups (the bordered elements) the content will open in a new window.

### On reading variable-length input
Here's the `Packet` generator field:
```javascript
this.generator = function* () {
    for (const bit of bits) {
        this.length += 1;
        this.bits.push(bit);
        yield bit;
    }
}.bind(this)();
```
And to get the next bit(s) I use these methods:
```javascript
this.nextBit = () => this.generator.next().value;
this.nextBits = (n) => Array.from({ length: n }, () => this.nextBit());
```
I found this worked better than an iterative index-based approach.
