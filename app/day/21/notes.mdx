## AoC Party

<Tutorial>
You can press the die (center) button to roll one dice at a time, and then to combine their values and move the pawn. You can restart using the left button and fast-forward using the button on the right. You'll see the scores of both players at the top.

Another solution that uses memoization. The track and movement of pawns was pretty easy, but the complex animations on the right side were where I spent most of the time.

I have to show you how I get the coordinates of the spaces, because I think it's really cool:
```javascript
export const coords = (i) => [
    Math.cos(((2 * Math.PI) / 10) * i) * 150,
    Math.sin(((2 * Math.PI) / 10) * i) * 150,
];
```
The die animation are heavily inspired by [Mario Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdmV7Vbi4nM).
