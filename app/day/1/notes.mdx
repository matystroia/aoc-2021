## Here we go

It seems like **forever** ago that I started this. At this point I was still just getting my feet wet with Tailwind. Was also trying to anticipate the kinds of components I would need going forward.

### On `ObjectInspector`
I actually wrote the `ObjectInspector` that you're seeing at the top before starting on the actual challenges themselves. I remember looking at the developer console in Chrome and Firefox and trying to come up with a design that took inspiration from both.

In hindsight it was **not** the best use of my time as I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. That's mainly because I chose to focus on making the challenges **visually interesting** instead of just displaying the answer and calling it a day.

Actually, since I'm writing these notes in MDX, I think I can just use it here:

<ObjectInspector>
{{a: 'Hello World!', b: 42, c: [1, 2, 3], d: {nested1: {nested2: [0]}}}}
</ObjectInspector>

Pretty cool, right?

### On the challenge layout
Maybe you've also noticed that the buttons that are supposed to toggle between the first and second parts don't do anything. That's because this was before I added the overlay (the one you just used to open this dialog). I sort of naively thought that I would just include the answers for both parts on the same page.
