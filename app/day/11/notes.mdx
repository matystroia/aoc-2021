## All Of The Lights

<Tutorial>
In the bottom left there's the current step number, followed by index of the current turn. The turns are equivalent to the process by which octopuses flash when their energy level reaches 10.

You can use the controls in the bottom right to move forward one turn, or restart from the beginning. In Part 2, you can press the third button to fast forward until all of the octopuses flash at the same time.

Another matrix challenge. I really enjoyed making this one. Displaying the inner process of the steps (the turns) added another layer of complexity that normally wouldn't have been present, but I think it was worth it to be able to see the flashing spreading between the cute octopuses.
