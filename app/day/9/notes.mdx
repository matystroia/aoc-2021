### Zdog

In my search to try and diversify the approaches I used for rendering these puzzles, I remembered reading about [Zdog](https://zzz.dog), a 3D JS engine. After installing and playing around with it for a while, I decided to try and do my own 3D rendering for this particular challenge and save Zdog for more complex models later on (spoiler alert: I never ended up using it).

Even though it went unused, I owe a great deal to this little library. I don't think I would've ended up having this much fun if it wasn't for that cute dog in their logo opening my eyes to the possiblities of 3D transforms. So thank you Zdog, and thank you [David DeSandro](https://desandro.com/) for making it!

### The 3D revelation

I think what I liked the most about 3D transforms was that this wasn't a `WebGL` context. This wasn't even a `canvas`. This were the same elements I had used so many times before, only _magically_ translated, rotated, and skewed along 3 axes.

I had a vague inkling about how 3D transforms worked, but having only skimmed [this article](https://css-tricks.com/css-in-3d-learning-to-think-in-cubes-instead-of-boxes/), I understood very little.

As far as math goes, this was fairly straightforward. If you know the y-axis difference between two squares, you can find the angle of the line connecting them using *(drumroll)* trigonometry!

As a more general observation, it's interesting just how far basic trigonometry will take you when you're dealing with simple 3D shapes. But more on that later.
