## Zdog

In my search to try and diversify the approaches I used for rendering these puzzles, I remembered reading about [Zdog](https://zzz.dog), a 3D JS engine. After `npm install`ing and playing around with it for a while, I got the idea to try and do my own 3D rendering for this particular challenge and save Zdog for more complex models later on (spoiler alert: I never ended up using it).

Even though it went unused, I owe a great deal to this little library. I don't think I would've ended up having this much fun if it wasn't for that cute dog in their logo opening my eyes to what is possible. So thank you Zdog, and thank you [David DeSandro](https://desandro.com/) for making it!

## The 3D revelation

I had a vague inkling about how 3D transforms worked, but I had no idea just how little I understood. Looking back it's a miracle any of this worked like I wanted it to. I also had no idea just how important trigonometry would be pushing forward (along the Z axis of course).

I think what I liked the most about 3D transforms was that this wasn't a `WebGL` context. This wasn't even a `canvas`. This were the same elements I had used so many times before, only _magically_ translated, rotated, and skewed along 3 axes.
