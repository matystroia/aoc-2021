## Cascading Style Speed

This is around the time that I realized how powerful of a tool utility-first CSS (and especially Tailwind) can be. I was _beyond_ amazed at what you can achieve in mere minutes. I've always been more of an iterative person when it comes to design, and Tailwind was exceptional at allowing me the freedom to iterate _extremely_ fast.

And it only got faster from there! As I became more familiar with Tailwind I could move a layout from my head onto the page with extreme precision and speed. For a real-time demonstration of what that feels like, I encourage you to watch the great demo Tailwind has at the top of their [landing page](https://tailwindcss.com).

I also have to mention their stellar [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) and unbelievably comprehensive [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs). Their plugin system is also very easy to use, so you can tailor the experience to your heart's desire.

### Bitwise golfing
If a picture is worth a thousand words, an event handler might be worth even more:
```javascript
const handleClick = (i) => {
    if (!isResult) {
        // :P
        onChange(number ^ (1 << (length - i - 1)));
    }
};
```
Writing snippets like this one was really fun all the way through and is, IMO, one of the better parts of working on a project like this.
