## Faster than you can say "iteration speed"

This is around the time that I kicked myself for not taking the time to learn utility-first CSS (and Tailwind) more seriously before. I was _beyond_ amazed at what you can achieve in terms of sheer **speed**.

What's even more amazing, however, is that it only got faster as I became more familiar with Tailwind. For a real-time demonstration of how this feels, I encourage you to watch the great demo Tailwind has at the top of their [landing page](https://tailwindcss.com).

I also have to mention their stellar [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) and extremely comprehensive [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Bitwise golfing
If a picture is worth a thousand words, an event handler might be worth even more:
```javascript
const handleClick = (i) => {
    if (!isResult) {
        // :P
        onChange(number ^ (1 << (length - i - 1)));
    }
};
```
Writing snippets like this one was really fun all the way through and is, IMO, one of the better parts of working alone.
