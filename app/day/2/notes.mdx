## Canvas Conundrum

Still under the illusion that I'm going to do most of these challenges using `canvas` elements, I press onward.

### More like "can't"vas

I think this is around the time that I figured, "surely the canvas API will be the main driver for transforming the Advent of Code challenges into front-end exercises".

Because how else are you supposed to represent (sometimes) large sets of data? It's obviously better than just showing the result (and some interim values) in an `ObjectInspector`. 

I suppose you _can_ provide some sort of (meaningful) visualization for most of these puzzles using only an HTML canvas. However, I also came to find that there are **many** other ways of _"front-ending"_ some of them. 

With that being said, this particular challenge molded itself extremely well to a canvas approach. Just look at that graph!

### On pointless abstractions

Story as old as time. You write a piece of code one time. You write it a slightly different version of it. By the third iteration you figure you're better off abstracting away the common denominator. 

This implicitly makes all three versions more convoluted. But that's a small price to pay for adding a shiny new tool to your belt, ready to be used whenever you need it again. Except it never happens.

On the other hand, the `ChallengeWrapper` I use to provide input data to the page components proved to be an extremely useful abstraction that saved me **a lot** of time and that I hardly had to update as time went on.

I have the luxury of hindsight now, but back then I had no way of knowing what would be a worthwhile use of my time. With that in mind, I think the lesson here is to postpone abstractions until the need for one is glaringly obvious.
