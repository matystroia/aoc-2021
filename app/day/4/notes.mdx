## Where we're going, we don't need `ObjectInspectors`

I still think this looks reasonably good for such an early challenge. I think that most of it is due to not having
<ObjectInspector>{{
    somethingLike: 'this'
}}</ObjectInspector> 
at the top of the page. Either way, this is the first of the many matrix based days. While I like [Day 11](/day/11) the best, I also enjoyed this one as I found watching the boards slowly disappear kind of relaxing :)

I have to sing `flex-gap`'s praises for a while, because I used it **a ton**. There's no better feeling than not having to use `:first-child` or `:last-child` selectors.

### On absolutely positioned buttons

This _also_ marks the first challenge where I had to put some (playback) buttons _somewhere_ on the page. You'll see them all over the place, as I never quite found a position that I liked enough.
