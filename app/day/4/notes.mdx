## Where we're going, we don't need `ObjectInspectors`

<Tutorial>
You can use the controls in the top right to go back and forward in time. The last drawn number appears below.

Pressing play will fast forward until the first board wins, or in the case of part 2, until the last board wins.

A friendly reminder to use the real input data for this one :)

First of the matrix based days. While I like [Day 11](/day/11) the best, I also enjoyed this one as I found watching the boards slowly disappear kind of relaxing...


I still think this looks reasonably good for such an early challenge. I think `flex-gap` is kind of underrated for letting us get rid of the `:first-child` and `:last-child` selectors. `gap-{n}` is one of the Tailwind classes that I've used **a ton** overall.

This _also_ marks the first challenge where I had to put some (playback) buttons _somewhere_ on the page. You'll continue to see them all over the place, as I never quite found a singular position where I could put all of them.
